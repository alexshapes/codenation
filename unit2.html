<h1>Unit 1 : Outcome 2 Review</h1>

<div class ="unit1">
<p>This website was entirely made in Visual Studio Code. Trello was also used to set up tasks and follow them.
While the tools selected to do this project were appropriate, I personally feel that not enough time was allocated for a beginner to research, create and finalize it properly.</p>
<p>The entire website is composed of 6 html files, one css file and images.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class ="unit1">
<p>
  Although i am not happy on how the website looks and feels and.I am overall happy as i feel i have learned a lot in a little amount of time through research, trial and error and a few headaches.
  <br>
  If more time was allowed on the project, i would look to greatly improve it bit by bit as i go along and know more and get more confident in html/css.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="unit1">
<p>Further improvements that I would like to make to this project : Improve Navigation bar, Add cool design elements, stylize the website overall, make it modern. </p>
