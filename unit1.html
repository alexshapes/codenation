<div class="unit1">
    <p>Technology has important effects on business operations.
    <br>
    <br>
      No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. For instance, take for example a project management scenario. In a project management scenario, various resources are required to achieve the result. 
    <br>
    <br>
    These can either be people, equipment, facilities, funding, or anything else capable of definition required for the completion of a project activity.</p>

  <p>So you might wonder, why do some digital projects fail?</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "paragraph2">
  <p>A simple answer to that could be communication, but there are lots of other reasons digital projects fail. Sometimes the project is not planned properly or maybe a vendor doesn't come through, or there isn't enough adequate buy-in or resources. In most scenarios, it's a combination of various factors, working together to disrupt even the best-laid plans.</p>
</div>

  <div class = "paragraph3">
    <p>Another view on why some digital projects fail is the lack of synergy and excitement in the responsible team developing. </p>
  </div>

<div class = "paragraph4">
<p>So what skills, or what do we actually need in order to carry out projects successfully?  </p>
</div>
<div class = "paragraph5">
<p>The popular answer would be that you need specific software, skills specific to the job, problem solving skills...etc. while that is true. Motivation, Drive and Determination are also very important when starting on a digital project.
Managing a digital project involves running in an integrated amount of time and tasks. Set up clear goals for each of them and assigning very specific tasks for each person with clear delivery deadlines. And since many of the tasks depend on one another being previously completed as a foundation for it. </p>
</div>

<div class = "paragraph6">
<p>A proven way to successfully carry out tasks is by being organized, but that is not always the case, that's why today we have technologies and services such as Trello and Kanban which are both project management tools and not only help you as an individual developer staying on top of your tasks, but it also allows multiple developers to join together and keep track on their work progress. </p>
</div>
<div class = "paragraph7">
<p>Trello and other project management tools have been gold during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It allowed developers and other IT professionals to remotely work on projects while staying organized and on top of tasks and deadlines.
  I also used Trello when i was in the process of building this blog. Have a look at my board : <a href="https://trello.com/b/EO8gnnUN/website-project">Here</a>


</div>
<br>
<div class = "paragraph8">
<p>Trello makes it easy to stay on top of tasks, it helps by allowing you to show what your objectives are, when you are working on them, and when you finish them. >Git helps in managing the code changes and errors for projects with a large codebase. It makes it easy to stage changes and revert back to a specific version easily. It has is now being used to automate the process of deployment for an application

<p>GDPR gives data subjects, such as users of online services, a greater degree of control over the processing of their data—it broadens the scope of their rights, giving them better insight into exactly how much information is stored about them, how it is used, and allowing them to restrict or even completely stop such processing of their data. For example, if you’d like to know what Spotify knows about you, you can ask them for a copy of all the data they store about you or even ask the company to wipe the entire dataset: your name, email, listening history, and so on.</p>
<br>
<p>Compliance with GDPR rules is ensured by giving public authorities adequate supervisory powers and rights to impose serious sanctions for infringements.</p>
<br>

<p>So what does it change for digital businesses around the globe?</p>

<br>
<p>Quite a lot, actually. First and foremost, GDPR regulates how companies store data. For example, from now on, every business has to design data flows in its services having in mind the principle of data minimization, meaning that the scope of collected data, the purposes of their processing, and their retention all have to be reduced to the absolute minimum. So, no more collecting and storing data “because we might need in the future,” which was—and still continues to be—a very common approach to data retention, examples of which include the widespread practice of collecting email contacts for marketing, sales purposes or even designing user account registration forms.</p>
<br>
<p>GDPR might also affect the image of your company—for example, if you fail to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data you store and process, and suffer a data breach, you might be obliged to communicate it not only to the relevant supervisory authority, but also to users affected by the breach. A hit like that is not the best PR and may cost you more than you could possibly imagine—both in terms of user confidence and money.</p>
