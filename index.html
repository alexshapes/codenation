<h1>About me</h1>

<div class ="unit1">
<p>Hello and welcome, my name is Alexandru Georgian Ciobanu and this is the final project for my course at Code Nation showcasing the html/css knowledge i have gained during 1 week. </p>
</div>
<div class ="unit1">
    <p>A little story about me, Before the Covid-19 i was working in hospitality as a head chef, but this didn't just come directly, I started as a kitchen porter, accumulated experience and I slowly became a Head Chef in my last 2 years. During the Covid-19 the limited company which I have worked for has been closed. The hospitality industry has been decimated during the pandemic, during this time, i decided to change my career into IT and learn new and exciting skills.   </p>
    </div>
<div class ="unit1">
    <p>I have always been a fool for technology I have always loved new inventions, computers, gadgets and just about anything that involves computers and softwares. You may wonder why didn't I follow this career path earlier. Main reason is that my math and learning skills were very poor, and I was always been put off by this, I never really thought i could actually learn how to program or code, so i started playing around with softwares like photoshop, dreamweaver, illustrator and i have acquired skills needed to design food menus, kitchen signs, alter photos, and many other things which came in handy later on.
    <br></p>
    <p>Things have changed since high school. Fast forward 10 years in the future i decided to try getting into tech again because of Covid-19 and Code Nation was there for me. They have introduced me to coding and software developing in a very exciting way.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class ="unit1">
    <p>I couldn't believe that i could code my first text based adventure game and a fully working atm cash machine software in Python programing language, a blog/website, all from codes in the Visual Studio Code. This not only has showed me that i can do things i never thought i could, but also made me review mathematics which i am slowly beginning to like.</p>
