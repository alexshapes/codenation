  Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</p>
  <p>In terms of efficiency, I could have been more efficient if i had more knowledge on the html/css language and coding in general. In terms of drawbacks of the IT tools used there no question about it, visual studio is more than enough for this.
    Although its not ideal because its not a big project. It would have been possible to do it in teams too, through the help of Slack and Trello, someone could write the content while someone else could work on the design, while a third person could do the connection of the links.

<p>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Best way to improve productivity and efficiency is by having a strong fundamental knowledge of the language. This way you can scale without problems because the code is properly handled and organized individually.
  Fast way? Use a template or a software such as Bootstrap which will also cut down on cost of having additional developers working on the project.

  Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</p>
<p>
  I would definitely start in a different order. Such as have all the written content ready, and after make use of the css code to stylize the website plus any additional touch up. Approach things differently

<p>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</p>
<p>
  Different browsers across different devices, type of customer journey (reset password example), completing E2E process with different devices, functions of the device / browser, error messages, pop ups, pop out pages, overlays , multiple session log in, to name a few.
